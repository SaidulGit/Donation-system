# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Project features
* Design the website with a clean and intuitive user interface to make the donation process simple and accessible. Users should be able to easily navigate through the site and understand how to contribute without any confusion.

* Implement a straightforward donation form with minimal fields, allowing donors to quickly complete their transactions. Use clear and concise language to explain the purpose of the donation and how it will be used.

* Provide regular updates on the impact of donations, showcasing success stories, milestones achieved, or specific projects funded. Transparency and accountability build a sense of connection between donors and the cause, encouraging ongoing support.
